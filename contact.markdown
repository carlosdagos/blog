## About me

My name is Carlos.

I'm an Argentine-Italian[^typical] born in [Las Heras, Mendoza (Argentina)](https://www.google.com/search?site=&tbm=isch&source=hp&q=mendoza+argentina)
circa 1989. I grew up in the US and Spain. I got my BSc. in Computer Science at
the [University of Málaga (Spain)](http://www.uma.es/etsi-informatica/?set_language=en).

I'll be posting what I think is of interest (to me) very sparingly, as I work
and study and writing is nice but takes a long time to be proofreading and
making sure that my forever mixed thoughts make any sense, cohesively speaking.

I'm always learning, so don't be surprised to find corrections from one post
to another. I'll always make them clear.

## You can stalk me

Here's a list of all the places where you can refer to me. I'm trying to change
my long-term handle[^pain] on websites, so perhaps these will break at some
point. I hardly make my social media about computers, but I really like music
and surfing, so I (re)post a lot about that.
