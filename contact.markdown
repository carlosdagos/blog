# Hey.

## My name is Carlos

And I was born in Las Heras, Mendoza (Argentina) circa 1989. I grew up in the US, where I made wonderful teenage friendships. Then I moved to Spain, where I made great personal development and where I got my BSc. in Computer Science at the [University of MÃ¡laga](http://www.uma.es/etsi-informatica/?set_language=en). Now I live in Basel, Switzerland. I work for an undisclosed company making, fixing, and maintaining software.

I'll be posting what I think is of interest (to me) very sparingly, as I work and study and writing is nice but takes a long time to be proofreading and making sure that my forever mixed thoughts have make any sense, cohesively speaking.

### And I'm angry... 

I wouldn't say I'm angry insofar to say I'm passionate. I'm not really angry, I don't really hate anybody (except **you**, yeah, you know who you are..). Basically a lot of my frustrations come from ignorance. So don't be surprised to find rectification from one post to another. I sometimes have an overconfident tone, which makes people listening to me believe me unconditionally. I would recommend against it :) 

### This is me

### You can stalk me..

#### [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/charlydagos) 

I will mostly just post pictures taken with my shitty phone about some of my hobbies and interests. I hardly make my social media about computers.

#### [Twitter](https://twitter.com/charlydagos)

I will mostly just post whatever I'm listening to, or stuff almost related to computers, or not.

### And... yeah... but only if you want to
