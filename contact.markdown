# Hey.

## My name is Carlos

And I'm an Argentine-Italian born in [Las Heras, Mendoza (Argentina)](https://www.google.com/search?site=&tbm=isch&source=hp&q=mendoza+argentina) circa 1989. I grew up in the US, where I made wonderful teenage friendships. Then I moved to Spain, where I also made great friends, and made great personal development. I got my BSc. in Computer Science at the [University of Málaga](http://www.uma.es/etsi-informatica/?set_language=en). Now I live in Basel, Switzerland, but depending on the time of the year you can find me in Zürich, Köln, Freiburg, or the Maldives. I work for an undisclosed company making, fixing, and maintaining software.

I'll be posting what I think is of interest (to me) very sparingly, as I work and study and writing is nice but takes a long time to be proofreading and making sure that my forever mixed thoughts make any sense, cohesively speaking.
 
I'm passionate about programming. I praise following standands, but along my posts you'll most of the time see me hacking. Because I love to hack.

I'm always learning, so don't be surprised to find corrections from one post to another. I'll make them clear, because I'm not ashamed of screwing up :)

I sometimes have an overconfident tone, which makes people listening to me believe me unconditionally. I would recommend against it.

### This is me

### You can stalk me..

#### [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/charlydagos) 

I will mostly just post pictures taken with my shitty phone about some of my hobbies and interests. I hardly make my social media about computers.

#### [Twitter](https://twitter.com/charlydagos)

I will mostly just post whatever I'm listening to, or stuff almost related to computers, or not.

#### [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/charlydagos)

Yeah.. what?

### And... yeah... but only if you want to
