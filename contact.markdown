# Hey.

## My name is Carlos

And I was born in Las Heras, Mendoza (Argentina) circa 1989. I grew up in the US, where I made wonderful teenage friendships. Then I moved to Spain, where I got my BSc. in Computer Science at the [University of MÃ¡laga](http://www.uma.es/etsi-informatica/?set_language=en). Now I live in Basel, Switzerland. I work for an undisclosed company making, fixing, and maintaining software.

### And I'm angry... 

I wouldn't say I'm angry insofar to say I'm passionate. I'm not really angry, I don't really hate anybody (except *you*, yeah, you know who you are..). Basically a lot of my frustrations come from ignorance. So don't be surprised to find rectification as from one post to another. I sometimes have an overconfident tone, which makes people listening to me believe me unconditionally. I would recommend against it :) 

### This is me

### And... yeah... but only if you want to
