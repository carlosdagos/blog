<h2>Hello and welcome...</h2>

<p>Welcome to my page and/or blog. I'm a programmer, I guess you could say. I'm normally a lurker, but I have plenty of opinions whenever I see stuff just browsing around, so I thought I'd share my thoughts.</p>

<p>Also because PR works this way in this day and age.</p>

<p>In my blog I'll be posting my opinions on various subjects ranging from encoding libraries, software architecture, software design, hello worlds in different languages, and basically anything I want... because it's my page.</p>

<p>I'm almost never not listening to music, so just for shits and giggles I'll post at the very last part of each entry what I was listening to when I was writing.</p>

<h3><a href="/contact.html">Find out more about me here</a></h3>

<p>Cheers.</p>
