<p>Welcome to the page hosted by the angriest programmer in the world. I grow quickly frustrated and irritated whenever I see some bullshit just browsing around. In these series I'll be posting my opinions on various subjects ranging from encoding libraries, software architecture, software design, hello worlds in different languages, and basically anything I want... because it's my page.</p>

<p>I'm almost never not listening to music, so just for shits and giggles I'll post at the very last part of each entry what I was listening to when I was writing.</p>

<h3><a href="/contact.html">Find out more about me here</a></h3>

<p>Cheers.</p>
