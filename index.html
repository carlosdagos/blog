<p>Welcome to my page and/or blog. I'm a programmer.</p>

<p>
I'm normally a lurker, but I have plenty of opinions whenever I see stuff
just browsing around, so I thought I'd share my thoughts. I'm almost never not
listening to music, so just for fun I'll post at the very last part of each
entry what I was listening to when I was writing.
