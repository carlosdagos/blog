_Some thoughts on the 2017 edition of LambdaWorld. My phone is broken so I
don't have any pics, but I'll just embed some tweets. I need to remind in
this post what's in the footer of my website: **All opinions are my own,
never of my current employer.**_

## Intro

I attended [LambdaWorld](http://www.lambda.world/), a really special kind of
conference that takes place in Cádiz, in southern Spain. It should be mentioned
that [47Degrees](https://twitter.com/47deg) is doing a great job in the region
and promoting the Spanish community at large.

It was an awesome experience which mixed meeting up with old friends, work
colleagues, talking day in and night out about functional programming, and
also partying, beer, and hanging out at the beach.

There was also, as always, some annoyances and "what the actual fuck" moments
which I'll discuss below.

## The good

#### Common Lisp workshop - Andrew Lawson

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Full house for Andrew Lawson, <a href="https://twitter.com/RavenPack?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RavenPack</a> Lisp Manager at Common Lisp Workshop <a href="https://twitter.com/Lambda_World?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Lambda_World</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LambdaWorld?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LambdaWorld</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Programming?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Programming</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/workshop?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#workshop</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/lisp?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#lisp</a> <a href="https://t.co/TRBlEygnjR">pic.twitter.com/TRBlEygnjR</a></p>&mdash; RavenPackers (@RavenPackers) <a href="https://twitter.com/RavenPackers/status/923569512267571201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 26, 2017</a></blockquote>

I'm perhaps a bit biased on this one, because Andrew is currently my
manager at [RavenPack](https://twitter.com/RavenPackers). However, Andrew
covered everything I like to hear about a language during his workshop,
including the bad parts and the potential drawbacks.

I write Common Lisp on a daily basis these days, so I don't need to be
further convinced about the good or bad parts about it, but to me what
made this workshop incredible was to see just how passionate, enthusiastic,
and down to earth Andrew is about Common Lisp. I think he transmitted this
enthusiasm to the folks around him, who were in turn also really into it.

Whoever's phone kept ringing, by the way, shame on you. Turn that shit off
and respect folks around you.

#### Everything you didn't want to know about monad transformer state - Michael Snoyman

[Link to the slides](https://www.snoyman.com/reveal/monad-transformer-state#/).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/snoyberg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@snoyberg</a> vs StateT &quot;in-the-large&quot; <a href="https://t.co/AwXqpU4mdH">pic.twitter.com/AwXqpU4mdH</a></p>&mdash; Mario Pastorelli (@mapastr) <a href="https://twitter.com/mapastr/status/923905292668231680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Michael gave an absolutely refreshing talk not just about `StateT`, but also
about the industrial usage of Haskell at large.

Again, really down to earth. I got to discuss with him about a few subjects and
some of the things he mentioned. It's always good to listen to people such as
himself who don't have Haskell as an idealised utopic language, but as a real
tool to Get Shit Done, and done well.

#### Going Higher - Alejandro Serrano

Damn, why there isn't a single tweet related to this talk is beyond me.

Alejandro, talked about _Impredicative Types_, which basically boiled down
to the use `forall` in Haskell.

Another, great, enthusiastic, down to earth, and (somewhat) approachable talk.

Because I can't find a tweet or the slides, I'll just share his love for the
food we had a the RavenPack booth:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="es"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">And awesome cheese too! <a href="https://t.co/YpqGqsjLw9">https://t.co/YpqGqsjLw9</a></p>&mdash; Alejandro || Serras (@trupill) <a href="https://twitter.com/trupill/status/923618075915767808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">26 de octubre de 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## The bad

#### (Keynote) Profunctor Optics - Bartosz Milewski

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We went seriously deep today with the profunctor <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Optics?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Optics</a> keynote by <a href="https://twitter.com/BartoszMilewski?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BartoszMilewski</a> today at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LambdaWorld?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LambdaWorld</a>: <a href="https://t.co/NO8vSomaYD">pic.twitter.com/NO8vSomaYD</a></p>&mdash; Lambda World (@Lambda_World) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lambda_World/status/923880643490189312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Though I think that Bartosz is an incredibly smart person, whose [written](https://bartoszmilewski.com/)
and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8LbkfSSR58&list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM_)
material is amazing, this keynote was *seriously* inaccessible.

Keynotes are meant for the all of the attendees to join, and Bartosz's talk went
incredibly over the head of almost everyone there, including myself.

This wasn't the only keynote that I felt was very much inaccessible,
and, let's be honest, boring. And I don't know why the organizers decided
on them, but I fear there's some tendency to promote the "look at how smart
we all are" attitude, and to me it's just straight up [frontin](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=frontin).
Furthermore it promotes the whole "ivory tower" bullshit. Thumbs down.

## The ugly

If your talk's title starts with _"Don't fear the \<Insert Category Theory
Concept Here\>"_, I won't attend your talk, no matter the content or how
eloquent you are. I won't actually mention who does this, because you all know
who you are.

Nobody fears Monads, Monoids, Applicatives, Functors, or anything, and the whole
"have no fear" bit is not only already old, but it's also condescending and
makes you look like a hack.

I'm so tired of people time and time again coming up with a different analogy
to what a Monad is. You know what would be nice? To have something like the
following slide at any moment:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/carlosdagos/e91b373838e563a44f5c2ea85a8527f7.js"></script>

I don't care if you come up with the closest analogy of a Monad, it'll never
be as accurate as the actual definition. Again, more "ivory tower" garbage which
just makes so many concepts unwelcoming from the "outside."

## The awesome

Getting invited to an amazing free dinner and an awesome presentation that
mixed culture, maths, and technology:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LambdaWorld?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LambdaWorld</a> speaker dinner is bringing together the magic of math, tech, and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Flamenco?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Flamenco</a> at a pretty special place. <a href="https://t.co/4cho3QxgHo">pic.twitter.com/4cho3QxgHo</a></p>&mdash; Lambda World (@Lambda_World) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lambda_World/status/923667511299764224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 26, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I live in Andalucía and over the years I've grown a taste for Flamenco, and I
learned so very much thanks to this. An unforgettable cultural and immersive
experience.

## So long, Andalucía

The Flamenco event was great not just from the point of view of the great
cultural history of the region, but also for me it was quite a great way
for me to, yet again, reliaze that I live in a truly special part of the world.

I'm moving to Australia at the end of next month, for a number of reasons, where
the biggest one of them is that it's something that I've been meaning to do
for a long time.

I'll write more about that (and - hopefully - share some surf pics) throughout
next year.

## Conclusion

LambdaWorld was great, and despite the fact that I'm passionate about my
criticisms, I will definitely come back to it as long as they keep doing it.

The organizers, as mentioned, are doing really important work for the region.
It's 70€ for the early bird ticket, and for that you get treated to great talks,
infinite amount of coffee, two lunches, one dinner, a party with **free beer
and a live concert** at a really great location... I really doubt they're making
any real profit off the conference, which makes me believe that their intention
is to bring FP to Andalucía[^betterlatethannever], and promote the local
community.

Thanks for everything!
