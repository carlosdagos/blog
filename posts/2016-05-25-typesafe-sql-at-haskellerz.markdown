So if [my logo](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.8.2.0/docs/src/Data.Functor.html#%3C%24%3E)
was any hint, I’m a huge sucker for Haskell and Functional
Programming in general, and in particular for Haskell. Not too long after
arriving to Switerland I had the pleasure of, by pure chance, meeting a few
people who have turned out to be quite influential in a very short time.

I mean, meeting them reminded me that I was already a huge fan of Haskell and
Lisp in University. I had put these things aside for a while and in essence I
had forgotten about some of the things that I love.

I showed up to the HaskellerZ talk to see a pretty cool talk on
[common Haskell mistakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3WGPuqfBLg).
After that, being in the awesome city of Zurich, and unable to pass on a beer,
I joined these fine fellas for dinner and drinks and had some great,
refreshing conversations regarding engineering in general. And upcoming
concerts, because it’s Zürich.

Not too long after that I was invited to give a talk on type safe, composable
SQL query generation in Haskell, and I, being cheeky, accepted.

The result is below.

Thanks Alex for offering, Simon for manning the camera and the lights, and
everyone who was there either in person or in spirit :)
