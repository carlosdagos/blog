## Intro

Around November or so the sun in Germany started to set early, and the darkness
started to consume the daylight, and so, like the birds, I flew south,
to my home in Málaga, Spain.

## PureScript

I've recently been working with Haskell and PureScript, and a call for talks
came up not too long ago in the [Frontend Málaga Group](https://www.meetup.com/Frontend-Malaga/events/234994685/). Being [cheeky](/posts/2016-05-25-typesafe-sql-at-haskellerz.html),
I decided to have a few words regarding PureScript.

The talk is oriented towards practicality and hitting the ground running should
anybody decide to get their hands dirty with PureScript:

Inside you will find some sample code along with the slides in PDF format.

There's a cool community of local and foreign programmers in Málaga, and I'm
really glad to be meeting up with them.

## Pictures of what I call home

After some time in the north of Europe, which is a cold, cold place, I've
really learned to appreciate home. Particuarly the sun, so it's not called
_Costa del Sol_ out of whim. I've been surfing _a lot_, too, so I really
appreciate the winter.

Some pics to share:

My favorite place to surf: Playa de los Lánces, Cádiz. It's a really fast
wave that's normally a left, which is great for a goofy-footed person like
myself. The sun sets right on your face, which makes for great afternoon
sessions. The water is turquoise and the sand is white, and I think it's hands
down one of the best beaches in the peninsula. Much, much better than shitty
_El Palmar_.

This is the right side of Malapesquera, in Benalmádena. It's quite fickle
but with the right conditions and wind you get some fun waves. You can walk
up the pier and jump from the rocks right next to the wave, which is always fun.

I just took this while having lunch one day near the center of Málaga, next to a
coworking space where I sometimes go work. You can't beat this sunlight in the
northern hemisphere in early December.
